        <p>
          To whom it may concern,
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon my appointment of teacher in charge of Computing at Wetherby High School, Josh stood out immediately as an excellent student of Computer Science and throughout the subsequent three years he demonstrated so many more qualities that I’m happy to share with you.

        </p>
        <p>
          In the classroom, Josh is an exemplary student to have in order to promote a model learning environment. He is engaged, inquisitive, polite and always ready to learn. This is demonstrated by his success in GCSE Computer Science and treasured by those that had the pleasure to teach him.

        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve been extremely fortunate to see Josh outside of the classroom environment also, as part of the after-school Computing club at Wetherby High. Here, I have not only seen a young student passionate about Computing and Physics (languages and music too, I might add) but I have seen this passion used to help and inform a range of students across the school community. Josh would happily assist and encourage younger students at the club and do so in a calm, friendly and often humorous way that not only benefitted their understanding but made them want to return the following week.

        </p>
        <p>
          Josh has always been keen to put his outstanding practical Computing skills into practice. Josh was recognised for his work in the school community when he created a revision website utilising his HTML knowledge that not only demonstrated excellent competency but showed a young person conscious and caring for those who are part of his team/community when he made this website available to all of the year group to assist them in their study. I also recall another of Josh’s qualities when he was a young GCSE student collaborating with 6th form students on the design of a program that was to be used to award merit points to students in school - he not only has the ability to communicate with students his own age but is equally at ease in conversation with younger students and in collaboration with those more advanced in years, including staff.

        </p>
        <p>
          Recently Josh has completed a period of work experience at Wetherby High School assisting myself in the delivery of GCSE Computer Science. Josh, as he did as a student, came 100% prepared and spent time preparing activities for the students that would both engage and challenge them. He would entwine his love of languages and science into Computing activities and this made topics such as data representation fun to learn. An observation I made from the very first session was how Josh would also make a note of any questions students had that he could not immediately answer and he’d come back the following week and enlighten them - as I mentioned earlier, always ready to learn. This was noted and appreciated by the students who were not just being taught but being **inspired** by Josh.

        </p>
        <p>
          I thoroughly recommend Josh to your organisation, knowing he’ll not only be an asset but a valuable team member.

        </p>
        <p>
          Yours faithfully

        </p>
        <p>
