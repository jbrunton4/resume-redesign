                    <u><b>Junior .NET Developer</b> - Jul 2023 - Present</u>
                    <p>
                        Currently working as a junior .NET developer in a small team delivering Dynamics 365
                        solutions to UK and international clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My first work for this company was in 2021, when I was contracted to develop a web
                        portal for monitoring an integrated solution. I was invited back for a full-time position
                        after graduating from sixth form.

                <section>
                    <u><b>Sixth Form</b></u>
                    <p>
                        My highest level of education is level 3 qualifications from studying at a sixth form college.
                        I studied computer science, French, health &amp; social care, and an EPQ (Extended Project
                        Qualification).
                        Graduated with C in computer science, B in French, pass in health &amp; social care and A in
                        EPQ.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My EPQ, written in 2022-23, explored the question "Could Machine Translation Solutions Replace
                        Human
                        Translators?".
                        This question linked heavily to my subject choices, and researching for the project gave me a
                        foundational
                        understanding of machine learning and language models, a highly relevant topic at the time of
                        writing with the recent
                        release of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

                <p>
                    During my time at sixth form, I participated in the ESA Astro Pi Challenge. I designed a program
                    to interact with specialised sensor and processor hardware, attempting to predict weather patterns
                    from pictures of clouds taken from orbit using machine learning. My project was accepted and run
                    on the International Space Station.

                <p>
                    I also participated in the CyberCenturion cyber security challenge, competing with other teams
                    nationwide to quickly patch security vulnerabilities in Windows and GNU/Linux systems.
                    My team progressed to the national semi-finals.

                <p>
                    After graduating high school, I took a fixed term volunteering opportunity leading GCSE computer
                    science classes. I also volunteered at the computing club at my sixth form college, aiding younger
                    students in personal endeavours.

                <p>
                    While graduating from high school, I received my school's Subject Award for Computer Science and
                    Business studies for outstanding performance and enthusiasm as well as volunteering, chosen from a
                    poolof more than 500 students.

                <p>
                    Currently, my personal goals include learning about software architecture principles in order
                    to build more robust software when making my own decisions on projects.

                <p>
                    I am also working to expand my knowledge of GNU/Linux due to its widespread use in the industry
                    and high customisability supporting highly productive workflows. I am accomplishing this by using
                    Arch Linux and WSL to streamline my development workflow.
