    <p class="c36 c42"><span>With over half a billion netizens having used online translators</span><sup><a
                href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>, one</span><span>&nbsp;cannot deny that machine
            translation is a greatly important industry &mdash; but can it ever replace the need for human translators?
            This paper aims to explain and discuss the history, current state, and future of machine translation, as
            well as the implications arising from potential developments in the field. </span></p>
    <h1 class="c5" id="h.q1ggj6wmq9rr"><span class="c20">Introduction</span></h1>
    <p class="c1"><span>With over 7000 languages spoken in the world today</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2"
                id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c3">, and with the rise of the internet, interlingual
            communication has become easier than ever. In this age of globalisation, translation has become an
            invaluable skill for individuals and businesses alike.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Languages, however, are notoriously
            difficult and time-consuming to learn, and even more so to master. Barriers to entering translation as a
            profession are often high, with most employers requiring at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree &mdash; a
            qualification that can cost tens of thousands more, and takes a year longer, than other similar
            qualifications. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">Despite its current shortcomings, machine translation offers a quick and easy
            alternative method to break the language barrier, and as such has become a widely used and relied upon
            service &mdash; but can it ever become so effective as to eliminate the need for human translators?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">This dissertation aims to educate on the history of machine translation, give
            commentary on the current state of the field, speculate on the future of the industry, and argue as to
            whether computers can &mdash; and should &mdash; eliminate the need for human translators. A tour of the

    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Machine translation is a field based in a much larger discipline: translation. Man
            has been translating between languages for as long as international relations have existed. The act of
            translation creates a bridge between people and cultures who would otherwise struggle to connect, promoting
            communication and connection between foreign peoples. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in the early years of
            translation, when inter-lingual communications were first established, machine translation and the computer
            as a concept had not yet been invented. For this reason, translation was a rare skill, due to the
            inaccessibility of language education. People lacked the ability to quickly search massive databases for
            words, and to instantly connect with fellow linguists to be educated on the nature of new and complex
            concepts. Should they have encountered someone who did not speak their mother tongue, the common person
            almost surely would have had no way to communicate. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">As time progressed, education in foreign languages became more accessible. With
            developments in international relationships, the populaces of adjacent countries became more likely to study
            each others&rsquo; languages. This was especially true in Europe, with a diverse variety of languages and
            cultures in close proximity to one another. With such inventions as the printing press, education became yet
            more accessible. Educational materials could be easily replicated and distributed to those who would be able
            to afford them. Developments such as the aeroplane made international travel easier than ever before,
            inevitably increasing the demand for people who could speak multiple languages. Language education was more
            accessible than ever &mdash; but despite all the world&rsquo;s advancements, this new age of
            interconnectedness brought a new challenge: There are simply too many languages. It takes years of study and
            experience to master just a single one, let alone the thousands spoken in the modern world. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">Alongside this problem, modern advancements gave way to a solution: Machine
            translation, or, the act of using a computer to translate between languages. With a perfect memory and high
            adaptability, computers seemed an invaluable tool to facilitate interlingual communication. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c22" id="h.kjs36a8b4iwz"><span class="c24">Word-For-Word Translation</span></h2>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.bgojyto6pe24"><span class="c21">Premise &amp; Proper Performance</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">The first translation software models were incredibly simplistic &mdash; simply
            substituting a word in one language for its equivalent in another. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a computational sense, this meant
            splitting up a string of text into a list of words, translating each one, and piecing the sentence back
            together. It is customary to refer to the language from which a passage is translated as the
            &ldquo;source&rdquo; language, and the content given to the computer as the &ldquo;input&rdquo;. Given
            these, the computer gives an &ldquo;output&rdquo; in the &ldquo;target&rdquo; language. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A visual explanation can be seen
            below, translating the sentence &ldquo;The dog eats&rdquo; from English into French. First, the algorithm
            separates the sentence into a list of words, by looking at the spaces in the sentence</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c9"><span class="c3">&ldquo;The dog eats&rdquo; &rarr; [&ldquo;The&rdquo;, &ldquo;dog&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;eats&rdquo;]</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">The computer then consults a dictionary &mdash; a list of words in one language and
            their equivalents in another. Coincidentally, a &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; is a common name for the data
            structure used to store such word pairs. Each word would be translated as so:</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c9"><span class="c3">&ldquo;The&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;Le&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c9"><span class="c3">&ldquo;dog&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;chien&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c9"><span class="c3">&ldquo;eats&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;mange&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">This list of words would then be re-constructed to form a complete sentence, with the
            original order of words still retained: </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c9"><span class="c3">[&ldquo;Le&rdquo;, &ldquo;chien&rdquo;, &ldquo;mange&rdquo;] &rarr; &ldquo;Le chien
            mange&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c8"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>The computer then produces its output and correctly arrives at the following conclusion: The
            English sentence &ldquo;The dog eats&rdquo;, translated into French, is &ldquo;Le chien mange&rdquo;.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span>On this particular occasion, the word-for-word translation algorithm has performed perfectly
            and produced an accurate output &mdash; however, language is a complex system, and even sentences as simple
            as the above leave room for error if one simply substitutes words. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.k8h36mjf2eoe"><span class="c21">Issue: Conjugations</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Conjugation&rdquo; refers to the modification of a verb to express qualities
            such as tense or mood, and/or to agree with grammatical aspects of relevant nouns (which might include
            gender, number, inclusivity, purpose, and more). While not all languages practise conjugation, many European
            languages make extensive use of it, to aid distinction between person, number, and tense. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span>In English, most conjugations in the present tense are the same, with only the 3</span><span
            class="c12">rd</span><span>&nbsp;person singular regularly being an outlier. Many other languages have one
            or more conjugations being identical. </span><span>Esperanto is a widely-spoken conlang</span><sup><a
                href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;whose verbs do not conjugate </span><span>for
            person</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or number. As an example, the verb &ldquo;man&#285;i&rdquo; (&ldquo;to
            eat&rdquo;) is always &ldquo;man&#285;as&rdquo; in the present tense. The table below shows the present
            conjugations of &ldquo;to eat&rdquo; and &ldquo;man&#285;i&rdquo;. </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Given this information, the computer knows that in translating from English into
            Esperanto, &ldquo;eats&rdquo; must become &ldquo;man&#285;as&rdquo; &mdash; however, working in the other
            direction, &ldquo;man&#285;as&rdquo; might become &ldquo;eat&rdquo; or &ldquo;eats&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">Continuing with the previous example, the correct translation of &ldquo;the dog
            eats&rdquo; in Esperanto is &ldquo;la hundo man&#285;as&rdquo;. In translating from English to Esperanto,
            the computer will always produce the correct output &mdash; each English word in the sentence has only one
            equivalent in Esperanto. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span>Translating from Esperanto to English, however, is more difficult: the algorithm does not
            understand that the dog takes the 3</span><span class="c12">rd</span><span>&nbsp;person singular
            conjugation, therefore the computer does not know which conjugation to choose and may produce the
            grammatically incorrect output, &ldquo;the dog </span><span>eat</span><span>&rdquo;. </span><span
            class="c3">Of course, this output is still comprehensible to a speaker of English, despite its clearly
            ungrammatical nature. If a reader did not know the output was produced by a simple machine, they would
            likely look down upon the writer for their poor grammar. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.ltufimu3bnxi"><span class="c21">Issue: Word order</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Yet more problems arise when the complexity of the input is increased even slightly,
            especially when translating between more distant languages.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">While many European languages use a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, other
            languages tend towards SOV (subject-object-verb) structures. One such language is Bengali (also known as
            Bangla), the official national language of Bangladesh. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Consider the English sentence, &ldquo;I eat rice&rdquo;. This sentence can be
            separated into its component words: [&ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;eat&rdquo;, &ldquo;rice&rdquo;]. Each word can
            then be translated into Bengali: [&ldquo;&#2438;&#2478;&#2495;&rdquo;, &ldquo;&#2454;&#2494;&#2439;&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;&#2477;&#2494;&#2468;&rdquo;] and re-assembled into the complete sentence
            &ldquo;&#2438;&#2478;&#2495; &#2454;&#2494;&#2439; &#2477;&#2494;&#2468;&rdquo; &#10216;ami k&#688;ai
            b&#688;at&#10217;. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c31">This output is grammatically incorrect. The correct translation,
            &ldquo;&#2438;&#2478;&#2495; &#2477;&#2494;&#2468; &#2454;&#2494;&#2439;&rdquo;
        </span><span>&#10216;</span><span class="c31">ami b&#688;at k&#688;ai</span><span>&#10217;</span><span
            class="c31">, follows a different word order &mdash; word for word, it means &ldquo;I rice eat&rdquo;. A
            simple word-for-word algorithm, however, cannot identify which word is the subject, verb, or object, and
            therefore cannot properly arrange the words to produce a correct translation. While a Bengali speaker might
            understand the grammatically incorrect &ldquo;&#2438;&#2478;&#2495; &#2454;&#2494;&#2439;
            &#2477;&#2494;&#2468;&rdquo;, it is clear that the sentence is wildly grammatically inaccurate, and failure
            to follow word order in more complex sentences might lead to miscommunications. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.yh9q0x4gfgf7"><span class="c21">Issue: Word Delimiters</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span>An additional problem with the word-for-word model, prominent when translating into certain
            languages, is that it relies on the computer&rsquo;s ability to define a &ldquo;word&rdquo;. Even among
            linguists, the existence and definition of &ldquo;words&rdquo; is a debated topic, as many languages do not
            make a clear distinction between the components of their sentences</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6"
                id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c3">. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In English, one might think of a word
            as a relatively simple concept &mdash; perhaps defining it along the lines of &ldquo;a lexical unit
            separated from others of its type by spaces or punctuation&rdquo;. As this generally holds true, it is
            relatively straightforward for a computer to distinguish where one word in English ends and another begins:
            It simply looks for a blank space. In other words, when splitting a sentence into words, the space is the
            delimiter. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all languages, however, make clear
            distinction between words. See here Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, translated from

    <h3 class="c17" id="h.ah5i6qafa7c"><span class="c21">Summary</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span>As can be seen, the primitive word-for-word translation algorithm does not perform particularly
            well in a vast majority of cases, losing accuracy as the complexity of the inputs and the distance between
            the languages increase. The problems listed above prove beyond doubt that word-for-word translation, while
            occasionally acceptable for the rough translation of simple sentences, is not at all suited to accurately
            translate more complex and intricate texts. This sparked the birth of the next major era of machine
            translation, with the implementation of rules. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c22" id="h.a4wy7j45rziy"><span class="c24">Implementation of Rules</span></h2>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.nbxxt64j9om"><span class="c21">Premise &amp; Proper Performance</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">To combat the issue of translation algorithms producing grammatically incorrect
            outputs, more advanced algorithms were developed, implementing grammatical rules. To compare a simple
            word-for-word algorithm against an algorithm with rules, an example is provided from Portuguese.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">The English sentence &ldquo;He is tall&rdquo; is correctly translated into
            Portuguese as &ldquo;Ele &eacute; alto&rdquo;. A word-for-word algorithm may produce this output by chance
            &mdash; though it may also output &ldquo;Ele &eacute; alta&rdquo;, as it has no insight as to which form of
            the adjective (alto/alta) to use. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">A rules-based algorithm would be aware that the use of the masculine pronoun
            &ldquo;ele&rdquo; must always go with the masculine adjective &ldquo;alto&rdquo;. Similarly, if the feminine
            pronoun &ldquo;ela&rdquo; was used, the feminine adjective &ldquo;alta&rdquo; would be selected instead. The
            implementation of rules mitigates many issues regarding varying forms of words in target languages, solving
            many problems regarding conjugation and agreement prevalent in word-for-word algorithms. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span>Rules-based algorithms are also particularly effective when word order differs. As is the
            case with most romance languages, Portuguese puts its adjectives after its nouns in most cases. An example
            would be the sentence &ldquo;the red apple&rdquo;. Assuming that, by chance, the correct article and
            adjective forms are chosen, substituting each individual word gives &ldquo;A
        </span><span>vermelha</span><span>&nbsp;ma&ccedil;&atilde;&rdquo;, which is still grammatically incorrect. A
            rules-based algorithm is aware of the difference in word order, and as such can produce the grammatically
            correct output &ldquo;A ma&ccedil;&atilde; </span><span>vermelha</span><span class="c3">&rdquo;. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">Rules-based algorithms tackle many of the downfalls of word-for-word algorithms
            when it comes to differences in grammar between source and target languages.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.p0zyvwp9jnec"><span class="c21">Issue: Exceptions </span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Despite being a significant improvement upon its predecessor, the rules-based
            algorithm type was far from perfect. A major issue is exceptions. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, it is possible to code for these
            exceptions &mdash; but not always. In Spanish, adjectives normally come after nouns. Some patterns for
            exception are simple &mdash; for example, adjectives precede nouns if used in an exclamatory manner after
            &ldquo;Qu&eacute;&rdquo; (e.g. &ldquo;Qu&eacute; hermoso p&aacute;jaro!&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;what a
            beautiful bird!&rdquo;), or when discussing quantity. In contrast, Spanish adjectives may also be placed
            before the noun when they describe an &ldquo;inherent or assumed quality&rdquo;, or if they reflect a
            &ldquo;subjective characteristic or opinion&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10"
                id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c3">. As the translation algorithm lacks the awareness to
            know when adjectives meet these criteria, it is nigh-impossible to determine when is appropriate to apply
            this exception. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.7zdclfuz2dja"><span class="c21">Issue: Homonyms </span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">The rule-based algorithm also struggles to perform accurately in the presence of
            homonyms: Different words with a single spelling and/or pronunciation. Homonyms may share a common spelling
            in the source language, but different spellings in the target language. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">A common homonym in English is the word &ldquo;bow&rdquo; &mdash; when pronounced
            /b&#601;&#650;/ (rhyming with &ldquo;show&rdquo;), it may mean: </span></p>
    <ul class="c54 lst-kix_ogyszwd2qwqh-0 start">
        <li class="c1 c48 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Bow (noun): a knot tied with two loops and two loose ends
                [...]</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c48 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Bow (noun): a weapon for shooting arrows [...]</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c48 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Bow (noun): a long, partially curved rod with horsehair
                stretched along its length [...]</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">However, the word can also be read as /ba&#650;/ (rhyming with &ldquo;cow&rdquo;), to
            mean: </span></p>
    <ul class="c54 lst-kix_x9lb5nb8istg-0 start">
        <li class="c1 c48 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Bow (verb): Bend the head or upper part of the body [...]</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c1 c48 li-bullet-0"><span>Bow (noun): The forward part of a pleasure craft</span><sup><a
                    href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="c1"><span>And at least 7 more interpretations</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12"
                id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c3">. To demonstrate the problems arising from the existence
            of homonyms, we will focus on only two definitions: That of a weapon, and that of a decorative knot. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Italian, &ldquo;bow&rdquo; (/b&#601;&#650;/,
            weapon) is &ldquo;un arco&rdquo;, and is usually used with the verb &ldquo;tirare&rdquo;, meaning to shoot
            or fire. &ldquo;Bow&rdquo; (/ba&#650;/, decorative knot) is &ldquo;un </span><span>fiocco</span><span
            class="c3">&rdquo;, and is often used with &ldquo;fare&rdquo;, meaning to do or make. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might assume that the rules-based
            algorithm might detect the verb used in relation to the noun, and therefore select the appropriate
            translation of the noun. This, however, is usually not the case, as programmers are unlikely to consider
            such cases.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the computer may produce incorrect
            and nonsensical outputs such as &ldquo;</span><span>tirare</span><span>&nbsp;un
        </span><span>fiocco</span><span class="c3">&rdquo; &mdash; to fire a decorative bow. As the words in Italian are
            completely different, an Italian speaker would likely struggle to understand the intended meaning of the
            sentence.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.i1j8qbfow3bb"><span class="c21">Issue: Development Restrictions</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span>Grammatical complexity is not the only hurdle faced in the development of rules-based
            algorithms. When developing software, two major concerns are the time taken to develop, and the final
            &ldquo;size&rdquo; of the project</span><sup><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span
            class="c3">. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">With thousands of languages in the world, most of which have countless
            exceptions, it is impractical (if not impossible) to code for every exception for which software can
            account. It simply takes too much time, and, if commissioned by a company, would be too expensive to fund
            development. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.oo5nfiyn5nbz"><span class="c21">Summary</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">For some time, rules-based translation algorithms were limited by the knowledge,
            skill, and investment of those who programmed them, and as such, the industry had hit another standstill
            &mdash; that is, until developments in the field of computer science allowed for the rise of
            statistics-based translation solutions. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c22" id="h.p9y1lsp7txn1"><span class="c24">Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)</span></h2>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.uomgyharzgj"><span class="c21">Premise</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span>Statistical Machine Translation, abbreviated as SMT, &ldquo;deals with automatically mapping
            sentences in one human language [...] into another&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt14"
                id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c3">. This differs from previous iterations of the
            translation algorithm in one key way: It maps complete sentences, as opposed to components of sentences.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In simple terms, this means that the
            computer is given vast amounts of reference material translated between two languages. This is usually in
            the form of translated books. Using a complex computational technique known as machine learning, the
            computer can find one sentence in the source language, and its equivalent in the translated version. It then
            learns that these sentences are roughly equivalent. With enough source material (i.e., a large enough
            codex), the computer can build up a massive repository of information. Despite not understanding the content
            it is processing, it &ldquo;knows&rdquo; that certain words and phrases in a pair of languages are generally
            translated in certain ways. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an SMT algorithm has built up
            enough information, it can be used to translate. It takes the sentences in the input and produces the output
            that is statistically most likely to be correct, based on the text it has &ldquo;read&rdquo; in the past.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">This overcomes the past prominent issues of exceptions and programming time. One
            of the main advantages of the SMT algorithm was that it could pick up on exceptions automatically, since it
            learned from consuming source material (a technique highly recommended among the language learning
            community), as opposed to simply memorising vocabulary and grammar. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">Another selling point of the SMT algorithm type was its scalability. Instead of
            paying a programmer to expand the capabilities of the translation solution, one could simply add to its
            repository of knowledge. This meant that programmers no longer had to spend hours on end coding hundreds of
            thousands of words and rules, and their employers no longer had to fork out thousands to fund such work.
        </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.6pl6y2t8m25h"><span class="c21">Issue: Inaccuracies</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">As with all translation systems to date, SMT algorithms are by no means completely
            accurate. In fact, as their outputs are statistically generated (as opposed to pre-programmed), those who
            program these models have significantly less influence over the output. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common way to validate outputs,
            employed by such services as Google Translate (see below), is to have users submit their own data (which
            helps to keep the codex updated with more modern language to compensate for linguistic drift), and review
            outputs provided by the service should they already speak the source and target language with some degree of
            competency. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An issue arises when bad actors give
            inaccurate information to SMT models &mdash; providing incorrect translations, or marking accurate
            translations as incorrect and vice versa. This is referred to as &ldquo;dirty data&rdquo;. </span></p>

    <h3 class="c17" id="h.u24s8no6w0c4"><span class="c21">Issue: Dirty Data, Bias &amp; West-Centrism</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Dirty Data is a common issue faced by machine learning models and specialists. This
            term refers to when a machine learning model is fed inaccurate data. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirty data comes in many types. One of the most
            clearly damaging types is incorrect data. Consider those who do not know, or do not care to acknowledge, the
            difference between &ldquo;their&rdquo; (pronoun), &ldquo;there&rdquo; (multifunctional), and
            &ldquo;they&rsquo;re&rdquo; (contraction of pronoun and verb). As these words are homophones, pronounced
            /&eth;e&#601;(r)/, many people opt to use just one form in writing. While an English speaker can recognise
            the intended meaning from the incorrect spelling, the existence of language privilege</span><sup><a
                href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;means that one might be looked down
            upon for failing to use the appropriate spelling. Allowing the use of the incorrect form of
            /&eth;e&#601;(r)/ to appear in source material can lead to the translation algorithm using the incorrect
            spelling in an output, reducing accuracy. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another type of dirty data is outdated data. In
            terms of translation algorithms, this can primarily refer to older uses of language. As an example, if a
            translation algorithm was trained only on the works of Shakespeare, its outputs would sound much like
            Shakespeare, appearing unnatural to the modern speaker of English. Of course, this is an extreme example,
            however linguistic change can happen over relatively short periods of time. Works from the 20</span><span
            class="c12">th</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;century, especially the earlier half, generally used terms for
            minorities, especially people of African or Asian descent and LGBTQ+ people, that are no longer polite or
            acceptable to use due to their history. This can lead to problems in the political correctness of the
            outputs, and therefore reduce the desirability of the translation algorithms. As mentioned above, this can
            be combated by constantly training with new source material (as well as discarding or limiting the influence
            of older materials).</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation algorithms based on source material
            can also become subject to biases present in the source material. In March of 2021, a Twitter user by the
            name of Dora Vargha (@DoraVargha) shared a tweet claiming, &ldquo;Hungarian is a gender-neutral language, it
            has no gendered pronouns, so Google Translate automatically chooses the gender for you. Here is how everyday
            sexism is constantly encoded in 2021&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt16"
                id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span>. Attached to their tweet is the following screenshot to serve as
            evidence</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c3">.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span
            style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 601.70px; height: 116.00px;"><img

                title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen, Hungarian does not
            distinguish between social gender with pronouns as English does. Instead, it uses a single gender-neutral
            pronoun, &ldquo;&#337;&rdquo;, to let the reader or listener know that the speaker is referring to a person.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this information came to light,
            software engineers took the approach of re-training on smaller data sets: &ldquo;Instead of [editing the
            entire source codex], we decided to retrain existing translation systems with targeted lessons. When we
            spotted a bias in existing tools, we decided to retrain them on new, smaller data sets &ndash; a bit like an
            afternoon of gender-sensitivity training at work&rdquo;. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the validity of &ldquo;they&rdquo; as a
            gender-neutral singular third person pronoun in English is widely disputed by linguists and non-linguists
            alike (with speakers of British English being more likely to accept its use</span><sup><a href="#ftnt18"
                id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span>), using it as such here can create ambiguity &mdash; in many
            translations, &ldquo;they&rdquo; may be used in a singular or plural sense. Garner&rsquo;s Modern American
            Usage (2</span><span class="c12">nd</span><span>&nbsp;edition) recommends caution while using the singular
            &ldquo;they&rdquo;, stating, &ldquo;where noun-pronoun disagreement can be avoided, avoid
            it&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span>. Google Translate now specifies
            sentences referring to a singular person </span><span>of ambiguous</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;gender by
            providing two translations &mdash; one using masculine terms and one using feminine &mdash; and reserves
            &ldquo;they&rdquo; exclusively for plural groups, as demonstrated in the below image.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of bias goes far beyond
            gender stereotypes &mdash; bias can affect translation in many forms. It can be especially prominent when
            generating translations based on limited data sets &mdash; for example, when two languages have little
            pre-existing material translated between them, they are often trained on a version of the Christian bible,
            which has been translated into most languages, and therefore the model becomes subject to its biases. Bias
            can affect the quality of translation, as well as (potentially incorrectly) implying opinions held by the
            person who produced the input or a company supplying the translation solution. </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Due to modern translation solutions being the first solutions with adequate quality
            for public use, many people are most familiar with them. The most well-known services today include Google
            Translate, Bing Translate, and DeepL. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern translation solutions do not just consist
            of text inputs and outputs &mdash; the translation model itself works in tandem with other components to
            adapt inputs and outputs to and from a variety of media. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c22" id="h.1dd6neqogj91"><span class="c24">An Introduction to Neural Machine Translation (NMT)</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Neural Machine Translation, or NMT, is the core concept behind the algorithms seen in
            modern translation services such as DeepL and Google Translate. One of the primary benefits of NMT is its
            ability to train directly on source language and target language pair texts, whereas SMT requires more
            complex inputs. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After training, the NMT model takes
            an input and encodes it into &ldquo;vectors&rdquo; &mdash; a machine learning term for a representation of
            the input called a &ldquo;context&rdquo; &mdash; a digital summary of the input that makes sense only to the
            algorithm. The model then decodes this context into the target language. It is important to note that no
            actual understanding or simulation of understanding takes place in NMT. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, of course, a gross
            oversimplification of events; there are many nuances and modifications to this fundamental NMT model that
            increase the quality of outputs. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c22" id="h.6fn2o4desop1"><span class="c24">Technologies Associated with Modern Machine Translation
            Solutions</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Machine translation solutions are often not solely composed of just a machine
            translation algorithm, but other AI-driven tools to aid input and output. These include speech recognition
            and optical character (handwriting) recognition for input, and text-to-speech for outputs. It is worth
            noting that they suffer many of the same downfalls as translation algorithms, and as such, the more layers
            are involved before and after machine translation, the higher the margin for error. A truly perfect machine
            translation algorithm would require perfect input every time, and perfect conversion of outputs into various
            media if applicable. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to match the accuracy of a
            human translator, a machine translation solution would need to match its human counterpart&rsquo;s capacity
            not only to translate computerised text between languages, but also to interpret and mimic other forms and
            media of communication. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.s3qhdn546bx2"><span class="c21">Input Layer</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Tools applied in the input layer aid with changing an input from its original medium
            to the input taken by the machine translation algorithm (a string of text). </span></p>
    <h4 class="c33" id="h.a370b3c822wq"><span class="c44">Speech Recognition</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Speech recognition deals with taking audio input and outputting text based on the
            spoken language in the audio sample. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speech recognition algorithms can easily fail
            when speakers fail to distinguish sounds or words. Consider the following examples of the Korean language:
            &#50424;&#45936;&#50630;&#45716; &#10216;sseuldeeomneun&#10217;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt20"
                id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;vs. &#50424; &#45936; &#50630;&#45716;
            &#10216;sseul de eomneun&#10217;. &#50424;&#45936;&#50630;&#45716; means &ldquo;useless&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo;, or &ldquo;needless&rdquo;, while &#50424; &#45936; &#50630;&#45716; means
            &ldquo;no way to use&rdquo; or &ldquo;no value&rdquo;. In other words, where
            &#50424;&#45936;&#50630;&#45716; might refer to something undesirable due to lack of uses, &#50424; &#45936;
            &#50630;&#45716; might refer to something that would be hard to sell. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two adjectival phrases are
            phonetically identical. If a speaker did not pause for significant enough lengths to distinguish between the
            two, a speech recognition algorithm would stand a significant chance to choose the wrong one. Even if given
            some context, the similar meanings make it especially hard to distinguish in this case. As can be seen here,
            even languages with highly phonetic scripts such as Korean can bring challenges when attempting to
            transcribe without true understanding.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many languages have similar-sounding
            words and phrases, and all have a variety of accents and speakers, making it extremely difficult to train
            accurate speech recognition algorithms. If a speech recognition algorithm produces a bad output which is
            passed onto a translation algorithm, the translation may not reflect the speaker&rsquo;s intention. </span>
    </p>
    <h4 class="c33" id="h.r5xphonxhm29"><span class="c44">Optical Character Recognition</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Optical Character Recognition takes a raster image as an input and outputs the text
            character it is statistically most likely to represent. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optical Character Recognition
            algorithms are trained upon pairs of images and their equivalent text characters &mdash; for example, a
            drawing of the Arabic numeral &ldquo;zero&rdquo; would be labelled as the Unicode symbol 0 (U+0000). </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To process data, OCR algorithms
            typically increase the contrast of their inputs, separate them into what is most likely to be individual
            characters, then produce their best guess as to the Unicode character each glyph represents, before finally
            reconstructing the data into a string as the output. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common issue arising in OCR is similar glyphs
            &mdash; for example, the Arabic numeral 0 looks similar to the 15</span><span
            class="c12">th</span><span>&nbsp;letter of the English alphabet &ldquo;o&rdquo; or &ldquo;O&rdquo;, the
            Cyrillic</span><sup><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;letter
            &ldquo;</span><span>&#1060;</span><span class="c3">&#1092;&rdquo; /f(j)/, and other glyphs in other scripts
            and styles. Some OCR algorithms overcome this by inferring context &mdash; for example, a circular glyph
            surrounded by spaces and/or punctuation is more likely to be the numeral 0 than the letter O, and it is
            unlikely that said glyph would represent a Cyrillic letter if the surrounding characters were a part of the
            Latin alphabet. Despite this, the issue remains prominent in languages with extremely similar characters,
            and those which may be used in similar circumstances, such as the Latin script&rsquo;s hyphen
            &ldquo;-&rdquo; and em-dash &ldquo;&mdash;&rdquo;. &nbsp;Often, context is not enough of a clue, though the
            distinction between glyphs can be important if, for example, the output is to be processed by a computer
            algorithm. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.686zh1kbptbi"><span class="c21">Pre-Processing Layer</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Tools applied in the pre-processing layer may not always take input directly from the
            user, but are instead used to prepare the input or give additional context to the machine translation
            algorithm itself. </span></p>
    <h4 class="c33" id="h.x75kz372k0e6"><span class="c44">Autocorrect</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Autocorrect deals with automatically adjusting text to fix typographical errors (or
            &ldquo;typos&rdquo;). It is primarily present on mobile devices, which typically have smaller keyboards
            where it is easier to misclick a key, but is also implemented on some larger devices. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autocorrect, while often useful to
            aid with spelling and catch common errors, can malfunction and change the meaning of a sentence. As an
            example, it is generally more common to begin a sentence with &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll&rdquo; (a contraction of
            &ldquo;we will&rdquo;), than it is to begin a sentence with &ldquo;well&rdquo; (the interjection), therefore
            some autocorrect systems will automatically chance &ldquo;well&rdquo; to &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll&rdquo; at the
            beginning of a sentence. This can be overcome by considering context, especially that added later on &mdash;
            for example, &ldquo;well&rdquo; followed by a verb might be changed to &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll&rdquo;, but if the
            word &ldquo;then&rdquo; is placed at the end of the sentence, it might be changed back to &ldquo;well&rdquo;
            &mdash; though, of course, as with a larger overarching problem in translation, this solution cannot be
            perfect without a true understanding of the content of the sentence. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autocorrect can also attempt to
            &ldquo;correct&rdquo; existing words that are not in its vocabulary. A common example appears when using
            vulgar language in English: Due to the adjacency of &ldquo;D&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo; on the standard
            English Qwerty keyboard, a common obscenity is often corrected to &ldquo;duck&rdquo;. This happens
            frequently with new words, foreign loan words, and people&rsquo;s names. </span></p>
    <h4 class="c33" id="h.9zgg7s67u5pl"><span class="c44">Automatic Language Detection</span></h4>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Automatic language detection is the process of taking a text input and comparing it
            to examples of various languages to determine the language in which it is written.
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with most applications of machine learning discussed
            in this paper, automatic language detection performs far more accurately when its inputs are longer. In this
            case, it is because longer inputs are more differentiated. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norwegian and Danish are considered to be
            largely mutually intelligible languages as they both derive from the common Dano-Norwegian literary language
            which existed until the turn of the twentieth century</span><sup><a href="#ftnt22"
                id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c3">. In many cases, short examples of the languages are
            indistinguishable. As an example, the greeting &ldquo;Good morning, how are you?&rdquo; can be translated
            both into Norwegian and Danish as &ldquo;God morgen, hvordan har du det?&rdquo;. As such, an algorithm, or
            even a person, would be unable to say for certain if an instance of such a greeting was written by a speaker
            of Norwegian or Danish. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See below an example of Google Translate&rsquo;s

    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is an extreme example, but
            this can happen to more dissimilar pairs of languages, especially with smaller inputs. If an automatic
            language detection model misidentifies a language and begins to translate from or to the wrong language, it
            can cause confusion, and ultimately reduce the quality of the solution in which the model is applied.

        </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TTS algorithms do face some struggles
            &mdash; primarily, homographs. Homographs are sets of words with identical spellings, but differing
            meanings, regardless of whether or not their pronunciations are different. If a pair of words are
            homographs, but not homophones &mdash; in other words, if they are spelt identically, but sound distinct
            &mdash; a TTS algorithm can struggle to select the correct pronunciation without some level of understanding
            of the context. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TTS algorithms are also likely to mispronounce
            words when contextual changes are introduced. Cantonese is a pictographic language, similar to the more
            widely known Mandarin Chinese, that makes use of tones. When two Cantonese pictograms are used together to
            create a compound word, the tones in the word may change. As an example, the characters &#35282;
            &#10216;gok3&#10217; /k&#596;&#720;k&#794;</span><span class="c12">33</span><span>/</span><sup><a
                href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and &#33853; &#10216;lok6&#10217;
            /l&#596;&#720;k&#794;</span><span class="c12">22</span><span>/ can combine to form the word &#35282;&#33853;
            &#10216;gok3lok1&#10217; /k&#596;&#720;k&#794;</span><span class="c12">55</span><span>.
            l&#596;&#720;k&#794;</span><span class="c12">22</span><span>/. Here, the pronunciation of &#33853; has
            changed from &#10216;lok6&#10217;, with a flat low-mid tone, to &#10216;lok1&#10217;, with a flat high tone.
            The rule applied here is rather loose: &ldquo;If the second character in a two-syllable compound word is a
            low tone, it will typically be uplifted to one of the higher tones, either tone 1 or 2&rdquo;</span><sup><a
                href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c3">. Cantonese also has several other
            contextual tonal changes relying on loosely-enforced rules. Using the incorrect tones in Cantonese can
            significantly alter the meaning of a sentence, meaning that correct tonal pronunciation is important. For
            this reason, TTS algorithms often fall short in languages with more complex phonetic systems. </span></p>

            considered funny as it relies on a feature of the Japanese language to work. The joke in Japanese reads,
            &rdquo;&#12510;&#12452;&#12463;&#12523;&#12539;&#12472;&#12515;&#12463;&#12477;&#12531;&#12398;&#22909;&#12365;&#12394;&#33394;&#12399;&#20309;&#12391;&#12377;&#12363;&#65311;&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;&#38738;&#65281;&rdquo;. The punchline relies on the fact that &ldquo;&#38738;&rdquo; is pronounced
            &ldquo;/&rsquo;&aelig;. &#594;/&rdquo;, a reference to Michael Jackson&rsquo;s famous dance to James
            Brown&rsquo;s song &ldquo;I feel good&rdquo;, which begins with an exclamatory &ldquo;Ao!&rdquo;. </span>

    <p class="c1 c13"><span>Consider also Homer&rsquo;s classical Greek &mdash; some modern linguists propose that his
            &ldquo;wine-dark sea&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt29"

            concept of &ldquo;blue&rdquo; as we know it</span><sup><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span
            class="c12">,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span>. Translating simply
            &ldquo;blue&rdquo; into Homeric Greek may not be possible. Translating the reverse &mdash; a representation
            of the category in which our &ldquo;blue&rdquo; falls &mdash; into English risks creating such confusion as
            has struck many readers of </span><span class="c18">The Odyssey</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;trying to
            understand how the sea became the colour of wine. Some modern translators include footnotes or other
            disclaimers giving possible explanations as to Homer&rsquo;s choice of words. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above examples are just two of
            many occasions on which a simple translation does not suffice, and where further explanation might be
            necessary. Others include proverbs (especially in more &ldquo;poetic&rdquo; languages, such as Mandarin,
            which makes extensive use of proverbs that cannot be directly translated), as well as words and phrases with
            no appropriate direct translation (usually, but not always, nouns unique to cultures, which are often
            localised or transliterated). </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.4gboylqkivz"><span class="c21">Linguistic Drift &amp; New Words</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">As modern translation software is trained upon texts that have been translated
            between languages &mdash; mostly works of literature &mdash; they can have trouble keeping up with
            relatively modern uses of language and newly developed words. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, consider the English word
            &ldquo;yeet&rdquo;, which was added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary in September 2022</span><sup><a
                href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span>. &ldquo;Yeet&rdquo; is a verb and interjection
            meaning to throw, especially with force, apathy for where the object will land, and a connotation of
            &ldquo;good riddance&rdquo;. Example usages include, &ldquo;She yeeted</span><sup><a href="#ftnt34"
                id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;the basketball into the hoop&rdquo;, and,

            became a popular saying among young people and seems to have entered the general vocabulary of teens and
            some young adults. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite its widespread use today,
            many translation algorithms will not even attempt to approximate &ldquo;yeet&rdquo;, simply because they do
            not recognise it as a word. For this reason, it is important to keep translation algorithms updated with
            modern vocabulary, including slang &mdash; a difficult and rarely performed task. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.uayde6ojs4e7"><span class="c21">Ambiguity</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">While neural machine translation is undeniably an amazingly effective solution, it is
            not perfect. Its most prominent issue is that, like its predecessors, it lacks a true understanding of the
            translations it is producing. Such algorithms, by their nature, change parts of their outputs based on parts
            of the input that are not directly tied to the section in question, but true understanding also requires an
            awareness of the situation in which the input originated and/or where the output is to be used. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Indic languages can be traced back to a
            common ancestor language known as Sanskrit. Sanskrit is a notoriously vocabulary-dense language due to its
            unorthodox method of coining new words</span><sup><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span
            class="c3">.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>As an example, Sanskrit has over 70 known words to represent water</span><sup><a href="#ftnt38"
                id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup><span>, including &#2332;&#2354; &#10216;jala&#10217;,
            &#2340;&#2379;&#2332; &#10216;toja&#10217;, and &#2346;&#2366;&#2344;&#2368;&#2351; &#10216;pAn.ya&#10217;.
            Each of these has a different connotation &mdash; for example, &#2332;&#2354; simply means
            &ldquo;water&rdquo;, but &#2346;&#2366;&#2344;&#2368;&#2351; might also refer to any beverage, as an
            adjective as &ldquo;drinkable&rdquo; or &ldquo;intoxicated by alcohol&rdquo;, and even take on seemingly
            unrelated meanings such as &ldquo;cherished&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt39"
                id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span class="c3">. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While NMT algorithms can make
            assumptions and deductions based on the data it has seen in the past, it still lacks the element of context.
            With the many potential meanings of &#2346;&#2366;&#2344;&#2368;&#2351;, if used ambiguously, (e.g. as
            &#2350;&#2350; &#2346;&#2366;&#2344;&#2368;&#2351; &#2309;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2367; &#10216;mama pAnIya
            asti&#10217;, which might mean &ldquo;I have water [to drink]&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have a beverage&rdquo;), an
            NMT algorithm may understand all possible meanings of the word, but lacks the proper context to select the
            correct translation. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sanskrit demonstrates this
            particularly well, due to its relatively definite nature contrasting with the less-definite nature of
            English creating immense ambiguity, this issue exists between all languages, as words often do not have
            one-to-one translations. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.5vz199nsthhw"><span class="c21">English As The Middle-Man</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">An issue present in all modern forms of machine translation is a lack of available
            data between any given pair of languages. The world is dominated by just a few large languages. Most
            material of perceived importance is translated into one or more of the world&rsquo;s major languages &mdash;
            usually English, Mandarin, or Spanish. As translation is a lengthy and expensive process, it is impractical
            to translate into and between obscure languages. As such, comparatively little data exists to train SMT
            algorithms to translate between less-spoken languages. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common way to circumvent this issue
            is to use a &ldquo;middle-man&rdquo; language &mdash; instead of translating directly from a source language
            to a target language, translation happens from the source language to the middle-man, then from the
            middle-man into the target language. English is the most common choice for a middle-man, not only because it
            is one of the most widely spoken languages worldwide and is the primary language of a majority of countries
            spearheading machine translation, but also because English has a high number of translated works in common
            with the vast majority of languages. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of a middle-man language does
            have some drawbacks: not only does translating twice significantly increase the chance that translation
            errors might occur, but the output may lose some grammatically encoded information, due to the possibility
            that the source and target languages may share a feature that English lacks. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macedonian and Lithuanian are less commonly
            spoken languages, with 1.5 and 2.3 million speakers respectively</span><sup><a href="#ftnt40"
                id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup><span class="c12">,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt41"
                id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup><span>. Both have adjectives which change forms based on the grammatical
            or social gender of the noun to which they refer</span><sup><a href="#ftnt42"
                id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup><span class="c3">, as is the case in a majority of languages spoken in
            Europe. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">While a male speaker of Macedonian might say &ldquo;&#1032;&#1072;&#1089;
            &#1089;&#1091;&#1084; &#1091;&#1073;&#1072;&#1074;&rdquo; (Jas sum ubav) to mean &ldquo;I am pretty&rdquo;,
            a female speaker would instead say &ldquo;&#1032;&#1072;&#1089; &#1089;&#1091;&#1084;
            &#1091;&#1073;&#1072;&#1074;&#1072;&rdquo; (Jas sum ubava), to agree with their gender. A similar difference
            exists in Lithuanian: &ldquo;A&scaron; gra&#382;us&rdquo; for male speakers, and &ldquo;A&scaron;
            gra&#382;i&rdquo; for female speakers. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">These sentences do not only express the information that the speaker is claiming
            to be pretty &mdash; the speaker&#39;s gender is also encoded into the sentence via the form of the words
            spoken. Translating directly between the two languages retains this information, however, direct translation
            may not be possible if there is not significant training material translated between the two languages.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable translation between
            Macedonian and Lithuanian or vice versa, English may be used as a middleman. While the primary information
            in the sentence (that the speaker is claiming to be pretty) is retained, English adjectives do not change to
            compensate for gender, and therefore the gender of the speaker is lost. Many translation algorithms will
            assume to use the male form, since in many languages, the male form is the assumed default. To give a visual
            example: </span></p>

    <p class="c36 c8 c58"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">As can be seen here, using a middle-man language can cause grammatically encoded
            information to be lost or corrupted, limiting the accuracy of translation. </span></p>

            Machine-Independent Problems Arising From Users&rsquo; Incompetence</span></h1>
    <p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Problem exists between keyboard and chair&rdquo; (PEBKAC) is a term used by computer
            technicians and IT professionals to describe a user error</span><sup><a href="#ftnt43"
                id="ftnt_ref43">[43]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;&mdash; that is, an error that is produced as a
            result of the user&rsquo;s ignorant misuse of a program, as opposed to a fault in the program itself.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a perfect computer program will
            fail so long as its users have any say in its input, because users are always capable of giving &ldquo;bad
            inputs&rdquo;. Users are also liable to misinterpret information outputted by a computer program. As such,
            the issues discussed here apply to all machine translation solutions, present and future. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c22" id="h.fju9y0yi4m70"><span class="c24">Bad Inputs</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Speakers of languages tend to make mistakes or use alternative methods of
            communication that can create ambiguity. Consider the English homophones pronounced /j&#8580;:r/ &mdash;
            &ldquo;your&rdquo;, second person possessive pronoun &amp; adjective, and &ldquo;you&rsquo;re&rdquo;,
            contraction of &ldquo;you are&rdquo;. In writing, many people will always use &ldquo;your&rdquo;, as they
            may not know the difference, while in casual contexts, one may use &ldquo;your&rdquo; to mean
            &ldquo;you&rsquo;re&rdquo;, for simplicity, or because it is easier to type (indeed, one may also choose to
            substitute one or both spellings of /j&#8580;:r/ for &ldquo;ur&rdquo;). </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a proficient reader of English,
            the meaning can be inferred via context, even if it may paint the author in a negative light if used
            incorrectly in formal context, but when given as input to a translation algorithm, problems may arise.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider languages where the second
            person possessive pronoun (&ldquo;your&rdquo;) and the second person subjective with appropriate conjugation
            of &ldquo;to be&rdquo; (&ldquo;you&rsquo;re&rdquo;) are phonetically distinct &mdash; for example, Irish.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Irish, &ldquo;you&rdquo; is
            &ldquo;t&aacute;&rdquo; (with &ldquo;you&rsquo;re&rdquo; being &ldquo;t&aacute; t&uacute;&rdquo;), and
            &ldquo;your&rdquo; is &ldquo;do&rdquo;. The grammatically correct example sentence &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
            sleeping in your bed&rdquo; uses both forms of /j&#8580;:r/. Translated correctly into Irish, it reads
            &ldquo;T&aacute; t&uacute; i do </span><span>chodladh</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;i do leaba&rdquo;
            (literally, &ldquo;you are in your sleep in your bed&rdquo;). </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the wrong form of /j&#8580;:r/ is used in the
            source, the output may also be incorrect (though they are arguably equally incorrect, the mistake is much
            more prominent in Irish). If the translation solution cannot compensate for such errors, giving the input
            &ldquo;Your sleeping in </span><span>you&rsquo;re</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;bed&rdquo; may produce such
            outputs as &ldquo;Do codladh i t&aacute; t&uacute; leaba&rdquo;, a translation much more likely to spark
            confusion than the original. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such cases, the translation
            algorithm is technically at no fault &mdash; in fact, it performed perfectly. The error arises from the user
            providing bad input. Though the user is to blame, one might argue that the translator has failed by turning
            a comprehensible input into a potentially incomprehensible output. Though for &ldquo;minor&rdquo; errors
            such as this one, services such as autocorrect can usually account for the error, more clearly incorrect
            inputs still pose a significant risk to cause algorithms to produce a translation that fails to carry the
            speaker&rsquo;s message. </span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Even a perfectly accurate translation system would not be perfect &mdash; by no fault

    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take &#20154;, the Mandarin word meaning
            &ldquo;person&rdquo;, as an example. &#20154; is shown as &#10216;r&eacute;n&#10217; /&#656;</span><span
            class="c12">[b]</span><span>&#601;n</span><span class="c12">35</span><span class="c3">/, with the vowel
            similar to the one towards the end of the English word &ldquo;teacher&rdquo;. One who is familiar with the
            p&#299;ny&#299;n system, or with the mechanics of spoken Mandarin in general, would know that the
            &ldquo;&eacute;&rdquo; in &ldquo;r&eacute;n&rdquo; indicates that &#20154; is pronounced in this way &mdash;
            however, not everyone is familiar with this system. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In French, &ldquo;&eacute;&rdquo;
            denotes an /e&#618;/ sound, like the diphthong in the English word &ldquo;wait&rdquo;. The accent gives no
            indication as to the common tone or stress pattern of the word. A speaker of French may therefore interpret
            the pinyin &ldquo;r&eacute;n&rdquo; to be pronounced as /re&#618;n/, (like the English &ldquo;rain&rdquo;),
            ignoring pitch accent. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In context, a Chinese speaker would be able to
            easily distinguish that r&eacute;n refers to &#20154;, meaning person, as opposed to such phonetically and
            tonally identical characters such as </span><span class="c43">&#20219;
        </span><span>&#10216;r&eacute;n&#10217;</span><span class="c3 c43">, a Chinese surname. However, if
            mispronounced, a speaker may struggle or fail to identify the meaning, becoming confused or misinterpreting
            the sentence. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pronounced as &ldquo;r&egrave;n&rdquo; or
            /&#656;</span><span class="c12">[b]</span><span>&#601;n</span><span class="c12">51</span><span class="c3">/,
            the syllable can mean &#35748; (to recognise) or &#20219; (to allow). Further mispronunciations of tone may
            result in mistaking the butchered &ldquo;&#20154;&rdquo; for any number of other syllabic characters which
            are phonetically identical but tonally distinct.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can happen on massive scales when one
            phonetic syllable has many meanings based on tone as well as context. Ch&iacute;
            /&#648;&#642;&#688;i:</span><span class="c12">45</span><span>/ may refer to any of the following characters:
            &#25345; (hold), &#24347; (loose), &#39536; (fast), &#20360; (luxurious), or &#27744; (pond). Changing the
            tone of the syllable, Ch&igrave; (/&#648;&#642;&#688;i:</span><span class="c12">51</span><span>/) might mean
            &#36196; (red), &#28861; (burning hot), &#26021; (scold), or &#32709; (wing). Also pronounced
            /&#648;&#642;&#688;i:/ (with a variety of tones) are: &#40831;, &#23610;, &#32827;, &#21507;, &#30196;, and
            more</span><sup><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup><span>. This happens to such an extent that
            Chinese-American linguist, scholar, and poet &#36249;&#20803;&#20219; Zh&agrave;o Yu&aacute;nr&egrave;n
            composed a poem in classical Chinese, &#26045;&#27663;&#39135;&#29509;&#21490; (or &ldquo;The Lion-Eating

            &ldquo;shi&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span class="c3">.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a French speaker translates into Mandarin,

    <h1 class="c5" id="h.1zgaivpq4bao"><span class="c20">The Future of Machine Translation</span></h1>
    <p class="c1"><span>Due to the limitations of modern translation software, the difficulties in training and hiring
            human translations, and the ever-increasing demand for translation services, machine translation solutions
            are constantly being improved. Due to NMT&rsquo;s inability to comprehend context, the obvious next step in
            the field, which is already in development, is Natural Language Processing: teaching a computer to think
            about speech like a human. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c22" id="h.dbhi5ys2w5ik"><span>Natural Language Processing: The Next Step In Translation?</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Natural Language Processing &mdash; or NLP &mdash; refers to a machine learning
            algorithm that can process and understand language in the truest sense, as a human can. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern technology is already somewhat able to
            accomplish natural language processing. Services such as </span><span class="c2"><a class="c7"
                href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1692405439226876&amp;usg=AOvVaw3zl_Rkr_HJhccRT96oBh1j">ChatGPT</a></span><sup><a
                href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;use natural language processing</span><sup><a
                href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span class="c3">. They can understand several major
            languages and translate between them with some degree of accuracy, as well as performing with limited
            accuracy in translation involving less represented languages. Whether or not the GPT-3 model (and its
            in-development successor, GPT-4) can truly understand language in the way a human does is debatable, but it
            is undeniable that it can produce near-perfect imitations of human communication, including translations
            between the world&rsquo;s major languages. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural Language Processing
            translation models offer a series of improvements upon statistical machine translation. Their more
            &ldquo;true&rdquo; understanding of language allows them to translate between any pair of languages for
            which they have enough data to comprehend. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">This gives NLP algorithms many advantages over the previous SMT models. Firstly,
            depending on how the solution is built, the algorithm may be able to ask questions to obtain more necessary
            context and therefore avoid ambiguity. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">If connected to the internet, an NLP algorithm may be able to keep up with the
            most modern forms of communication, including new words, turns of phrase, and abbreviations. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span class="c3">NLP is generally capable of working around typos with a sort of built-in
            autocorrect capability that is much more contextually aware. As a part of the model, it also removes much of
            the need to invest in the development and integration of external autocorrect algorithms for the solution.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c13"><span>Finally, due to its more human-like understanding of language, there is no longer a need for
            middle-man languages, and therefore grammatically encoded data is less likely to be lost. It can adapt its
            translations and add clarification where necessary and, if constantly consuming new data, keep up with
            linguistic drift, even prioritising newer data. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c22" id="h.8qgomisrav1n"><span class="c24">Remaining Issues With NLP</span></h2>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Despite its advanced structure and features, natural language processing is not the
            be-all and end-all of translation. Many issues both to do with machine learning and translation in general
            persist through this advancement. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.4alm4awyr5j4"><span class="c21">Machine Learning Issues</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Firstly, it is important to remember that NLP algorithms still fall within the scope
            of machine learning, and are therefore still subject to dirty data and bias. If an NLP algorithm is trained
            upon linguistically non-standard data, it may begin to produce linguistically non-standard outputs. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Netizens often simplify spellings and
            grammar and omit punctuation from the language they produce online for the sake of simplicity. If an NLP
            algorithm does not have the capacity to understand that this is not commonly accepted as
            &ldquo;correct&rdquo; language, it may start to make spelling and grammatical errors in its output. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, many netizens have begun to use
            obscure synonyms or alternative terminology for sensitive topics to avoid censorship (such as
            &ldquo;expire&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;die&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt49"
                id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup><span>, or &ldquo;mascara&rdquo; as a metaphor for relationships, sexual
            experiences, and sexual assault</span><sup><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup><span
            class="c3">). As some of this language can be niche, and most is not considered proper language, users of
            translation services may not think it desirable, and therefore NLP algorithms may be considered low quality
            if they cannot avoid using such language. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as machine learning
            algorithms, NLP algorithms require vast amounts of data upon which to train &mdash; the less data on which
            such an algorithm is trained, the lower the quality of its translations will be. As many less-spoken
            languages (especially indigenous and minority languages) have little to no available content on which to
            train, NLP algorithms cannot translate them remotely competently, and therefore human translators remain
            essential for such languages. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.673owugmco9z"><span class="c21">Other Computational Issues</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Machine-related issues independent of NLP algorithms also play a role in NLP
            translation solutions. Though NLP can generally take care of autocorrect and automatic language detection,
            other input and output tools may still give bad outputs. In order to create a solution that can match a
            human translator in quality, not only must it have equal capabilities in translating text between languages
            &mdash; its associated input and output tools must also be of similar quality to that of a human. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another general computational issue with NLP is
            the sheer processing power and storage space it requires. The codices used to train an NLP algorithm would
            likely require one or more dedicated storage servers to host, and the resource-intensive translation
            processes can be taxing to run on home computers, as well as having a significant impact on electricity
            bills. The aforementioned ChatGPT service (running the OpenAI GPT-3 model at the time of writing) reportedly
            costs upwards of USD $100,000 daily to run</span><sup><a href="#ftnt51" id="ftnt_ref51">[51]</a></sup><span
            class="c3">.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c17" id="h.a8cg39xc6cym"><span class="c21">Non-Computational Issues</span></h3>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">A problem generally unrelated to machine translation, but still prevalent in the
            application of NMT algorithms, is retranslation. The algorithm may not always be asked to translate directly
            &mdash; a text may be translated by one person, then again by another, and again by another, each time
            potentially warping the meaning and/or losing grammatically encoded information. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the &ldquo;PEBCAK&rdquo;
            issue also remains: The user of an NLP solution may still use or pronounce an output incorrectly if they do
            not have adequate knowledge of the target language. The scale of modern computer systems struggles to
            support such resource-intensive activity, therefore, further developments in storage space and processors
            are also necessary to bring NLP translation into the hands of the consumer. This might be accomplished by
            recent developments in the field of quantum computing, a theoretical advanced method of computing allowing
            parallel processing and by bringing the storage capacity of data centres and the processing power of
            supercomputers into home-quality processors. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c22" id="h.kj6sfgiqjmzd"><span class="c24">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="c1"><span>Though NLP is without a doubt a major leap forward in the field of machine translation (as well
            as artificial intelligence in general), o</span><span>verall, a machine translation service is only as
            strong as its weakest component. This </span><span>means that major</span><span
            class="c3">&nbsp;developments in the quality of not just translation algorithms, but also speech
            recognition, OCR, and text-to-speech algorithms, are necessary to significantly improve the overall quality
            of machine translation services. </span></p>

    <h1 class="c5" id="h.3oiz2u7z2npg"><span class="c20">Summary &amp; Conclusions</span></h1>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Despite boasting many superiorities over the current &ldquo;status quo&rdquo; NMT
            algorithms, newly developed NLP translation solutions still face a number of significant barriers which
            prevent their quality from matching that of the human translator, and as such, the field of machine
            translation has a long way to go before human translators need worry for their jobs. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NLP algorithms are held back by the
            relatively low quality of other technologies applied in translation solutions, as well as general issues
            faced by all machine learning models, and the limitations of the modern computer. Furthermore, a comparative
            lack of training data in less widely-used languages limits the number of languages which can be effectively
            processed by NLP models, ensuring that human translators remain essential for such applications, at least
            until a significant enough amount of content has been produced in such uncommon languages. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there is always a human
            component to machine translation, as humans produce the input for the algorithms and often act upon the
            output. For this reason, even a theoretical perfect machine translator would not truly be perfect, for the
            risk that users may produce bad inputs and/or misuse outputs. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, though recent developments in AI
            and computer hardware have paved the way for a large jump forward in the quality of machine translation
            solutions, there are still significant developments to be made within the fields of machine learning,
            linguistics, and archivism before machine translation solutions can match the quality of human translators,
            and even then, it is important that users of such solutions have a degree of competence in the source and
            target languages in order to ensure clean inputs and the appropriate use of outputs. Furthermore, a lack of
            sufficient training data in all but the most popular languages ensures that human translators will be
            required for years to come, even if only to provide training data. </span></p>
